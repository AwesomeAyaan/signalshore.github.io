Title: Imitation wont get me there

How many times when we want to do something do we stop and think that
maybe what we are attempting to do is futile because we do not have
what the pros have ?

maybe it's because you dont have that cutting edge climbing shoes, or
that expensive camera, or that fancy guitar.

Most of us have some thing that we would like to get better at, be it
any particular sport or mathematics or computer programming or
trekking for that matter and in most of these fields there are certain
people who are at the very top. These are the inspiring poeple, these
are the people we look up to and often we imitate the habits of these
people, believing that imitation would help us get there. Now this
imitation can often take a bad turn. I'll make my case below.

What follows below was very true for me in certain aspects. YMMV. I do
not claim that I have the fundamental truth. All I know is that at
this point in time and space, this is true for me.


# All Imitation is not the same

I think that there are two very different forms of imitation. In one
form you look at a prollific programmer and you start
studying/practicisng how they practised. Or you look at the footsteps
of a developer that you admire and study what they did etc etc. I
believe that this is a good model to imitate.

On the other hand you have the kind of imitation where you look at
what posessions a person has or what tools that person uses and you
conclude that the posession/tool is a part of the reason why they are
so prolific. Case in point, it's the fancy Mac Book Pro that makes
prolific programmer so prolific and maybe, if you also use a Mac Book
Pro you would be equally closer to being prolific.

It might seem that these are small examples that I have cherry picked,
but I have seem myself do it a lot of times and I have seen other
people do it too.

# Where does this show up in the Tech Industry ?

Have you seen a popular Youtuber do a _setup tour_. Have you seen
questions like _which text editor does <insert person here> use_ (I
have googled this myself multiple times). There are multiple varieties
of this. Which window manager, which standing desk, which headphone,
etc etc.

Now, I am not saying that everyone who watches these videos are people
who want to get these gadgets so that they get better at whatever they
are trying to do. However, there are certain people who are trying to
find answers in the wrong places.

In tech this often happens in the form of someone explaining that
buying a _good_ laptop is the way to get started. Believe me, this
sort of advise is very common on the internet. I used to think this
too for a long time and I used to hate my current laptop which I
bought from college. It was a low-end device but nevertheless it was a
device that actually worked and it was the best I could afford at that
point. It took me quite some time to see that point.

I have seen inspiring people do inspiring work is shittier laptops and
I can tell you (and myself) that the choice of laptop does not
matter. It's a _good to have_, not a _neccecity_.

# A segway into Isomorphic Mimicry #

I heard of this term first time In episode 138 (12 dream reforms) on
the Seen and the Unseen podcast.

Isoorphic Mimicry is a form of cheap imitation. Its a process in which
nation states imitate some of the policies/techniques that are used in
other countries (countries that already have what they are trying to
achieve). This is what makes governemnts build expensive schools and
courthouses even if there are no students present and the justice
system is riddled with corruption for any courthouse to actually work.

Sometimes it can work, but it generally does not because it ignores
the subjective truths about a different countries. If you want to
model solution then you need to look deeper, look into what makes you
different (or unique) and then reason forward from there.

This applies to humans too.

# How did I fall into this trap ?

For a decent amount of time I used to believe that I needed a good and
powerful laptop to do good work. Which is not the case. 

I kind of like cycling, and for a long time I used to believe that I
need a very fancy bicycle so that I can do "proper" cycling. I
realized that there is no "proper" cycling, and any bicycle that you
own is okay.


How many times when we want to do something do we stop and think that maybe what we are attempting to do is futile because we do not have what the pros have ?

How many times have we convinced ourselves that we need something that the pros have in order to do somthing ?

This is quite true in case of cycling. Cycling happens to be a sport that I like and often times I would box myself in a category that "I cant do that because I don't have this so-and-so expensive bicycle"

I listened to this podcast episode where shruti rajgopalan talks about how the govt engages in this hting called "isomorphic mimicry" which basically means that it tries to mimic good things that the other govts have done elsewhere and implements them in india and then hopes that the outcomes will be the same. Clearly this is false because what works for them will not work for you. 

I realized that this is something I do too. and this is something that almost everyone does. 

Being a programmer there are loads of advise on the interenet about which laptops are good for programmers. Often these "guides" suggest something that is quite significantly expensive and not meant for the average person (with respect to india). 

There is a similar narrative in almost all forms of sport, where we are sold the idea that in order to become a pro or in oder to participate in that sport, you need to have some specialized equipment. 

You need running shoes for running.
You need special climbing shoes for climbing
you need a good laptop for programming.
you need an Gaming PC for gaming
 
If you read books you should buy a e-reader etc etc. 
All of this is just shit advise tbh.

What really matter is to get started. Just get started. And things will sort itself out. :-)

This is also partially inspired by a blog post on surly bikes web page which set me up to just get started.

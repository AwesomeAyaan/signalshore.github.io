Title: Reduce Waste Part 2

So back in January 2019 I decided to reduce the amount of waste I
produce on a monthly basis. Read it [here](https://signalshore.github.io/blog/What-a-waste.html).

Initial plan was to behave "normally" for three months and then try
the reduction thing. That did not work because I was inconsistent with
maintaining the record.

But, I am a consistent person generally speaking so it should not
matter too much and now 4 months later I have quite interesting
results.

Let's get to it. 

# Where are we
So right now when I look at my monthly schedule I can confidently say
that the only two sources of plastics on a monthly basis are the Oats
and the dates that I buy every month.

I'm still a bit sketchy on how many of these packets I need on a
monthly basis but the number should not be more than two packets each.

I should add that there are certain days when I do buy a pack biscuit
or a pack of peanut brittle etc etc, but I have managed to cut down
that number to almost zero.

So yeah, that is the tl;dr. Read on to know what else I tried.

# My Diet
I do not follow a very rigid diet plan however the basic rules that I follow are:
- minimize packaging of food (buy non packed food; order-in instead of
  take-out; no home delivery etc)
- eat local (nothing imported; imported has a higher carbon cost associated with it)
- minimize sugar
- eat less (yeah!!)

Also this goes without saying that I am /not/ a foodie. I eat so that
I can survive (rather don't die) and do other stuff that is important
to me. Food is just a necessity, an implementation detail. (I am
painfully aware how weird this apathy towards food is).

So, I eat lunch from a variety of different places and for dinner I
generally eat oats (just add hot water) and sometimes I have fruits. I
eat dates cause they are perfect for blood and they help with my sweet
tooth.


# Food Habits
Initially i used to skip a meal during the day. This was generally the
breakfast. I would skip breakfast and have lunch directly at noon,
followed by something light in the evening and then dinner by 10pm.

I tried to skip dinner and instead replacing it with breakfast. That
would mean that I would not have to buy Oats and my total food intake
would be same. That proved to be more difficult than I initially
thought.

I really like the tasteless-ness in my mouth when I wake up and the
idea of destroying that with food is un-ideal. So i try to maximize the
time I can go without food.

So, can't skip dinner.

Moreover, I formed a habit of buying a packet of peanut brittle after
lunch everyday. This was bad on multiple levels including adding a
plastic wrapper to my waste everyday and adding a bunch of sugar to my
diet.

However I could not will myself out of this habit.

Everything changed when I went to visit my family for 2 weeks. Those
two weeks without any schedule that I formed in Mumbai really reset
every habit that I had formed, and after returning I could not buy
that packet of peanut brittle after lunch.

# Normal Lifestyle
I'm quite spartan when it comes to other things and I do not buy stuff
unless absolutely needed. Very recently I bought an amazon Kindle
Paperwhite and I feel quite guilty about it. In my defense I wanted
this for a long time, ever since my school days.

Anyway, so yeah. 
This is where I am at.

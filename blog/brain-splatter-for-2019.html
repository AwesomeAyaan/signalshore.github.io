	<div itemprop="articleBody" class="article-body"><p>This is going to be a brain-splatter for myself at the beginning
of 2019.  The idea is that I will come back and read this and get
inspiration from my older self. There is a narrative that says that
you should not let the kid in you die. I try my best to do that, but
what if shit hits the fan. I want to have a backup so that I can look
back for reference. This is for the future me.</p>
<p>Also, this is my blog. I can do whatever I want with it.</p>
<h1>Write more. It's Okay!</h1>
<p>So I realize that I write less in my blog. That should change. The
blog is meant more for me and less for the reader. There are better
blogs out there for that purpose. I write because I want to read it later. </p>
<h1>Complexity</h1>
<p>Those who have seen me know that I for some reason find a lot of
things interesting. It's not rare for my friends to see me fully geek
out on toilets, or a nice jacket or a cut on the chin or a broken leg
or a hole in the ground or anything for that matter.</p>
<p>I love complexity; I find complexity marvellous and breadthtaking. I
love to think about complex interconnected systems. in fact most
things in life are massivly complex if you think deeply enough.</p>
<p>I read Carl Sagan's Cosmos during my school days and this book
literally changed my life.  I realized after reading this book that
the world is much more beautiful than it looks. :-)</p>
<p>Also, the world is much more complex that it looks. That is what makes
it so beautiful in the first place.</p>
<p>I am also very very hyperactive. Its quite difficult for me to stop
and do absolutely nothing. If you see me sitting somewhere, I am
probably building a spaceship in my head. </p>
<h1>Dabbling with Insignificance.</h1>
<p>Space has always fascinated me. Ever since I started to comprehend the
scale at which the universe operates I can not help but think about
the insignificance of our short lives. We are truely insignificant at
a cosmic scale. I remember reading about the cosmic calendar.  Carl
Sagan said that if we laid out the entire history of the universe in
the form of a calendar such that the big bang would be Januray 1st
00:00:00 and present day would be 31st December 11:59:59 then all of
human existence would be only the last 13 seconds. Yeah. Everything
that we have till date is just the last 13 seconds on a cosmic scale.</p>
<p>But Carl says "we are made of star-stuff; we are a way of the cosmos to know itself"</p>
<p>Isn't that powerful? :-)</p>
<h1>Think deeply.</h1>
<p>Think deeply. I have observed that often the most banal things in life
reveal their true beauty if you care enough to think deeply. What does
thinking deeply mean ?</p>
<p>Take any simple regular object. A pen. Simple enough right ? Not
really.  Hold on for a minute and think about all the coplexities
involved into making that pen. The probably has a refill. That refill
probably has some ink in it and a nib. That nib probably has a metal
ball on top or some other technology. How did all of that come into
existence ? How did humans even think of this ? </p>
<p>It took us 13 seconds to start from scratch to building bricks that
can do magic. We call them computers.  It took us 13 seconds to start
form scratch and to go to the moon.  It took us 13 seconds to start
from scratch and build everything that we have today.</p>
<h1>Be curious</h1>
<p>Unlike what some people I met think, there is no upper limit to how
much a human being can store in his/her head. Or even if there is,
there is no scientific literature to support that claim. </p>
<p>So, be curious. Don't stop asking "why" untill you are satisfied. And
do not be satisfied easily. Be curous about the complexity. Learn
about it. Marvel at it.</p>
<h1>Stop complaining.</h1>
<p>A lot of times when I wanted to do something, I would just
procrastinate on not doing it and instead figure out multiple ways to
not do it. Most of the time I would end up complaining about how I
could not do something and wait for someone else to rescue me.</p>
<p>This is not a good thing. I've wasted enough time doing this. Let's do
this less from now on.</p>
<p>Very recently I have started taking the other approach. Do everything
in my power and then complain. Because lets face it, there will always
be something that will not be in my power so instead of focusing in
that why not focus on the part that is within my power and do
that. Once that is done then we can worry about the part that is not
within my power.</p>
<h1>Be skeptical</h1>
<p>I have trust issues. I tend to not trust information unless its coming
from a very credible source and it has a lot of consensus. </p>
<p>This is kind of good as it means that I am bullet proof to rumurs and
other things, but the down side is that I tend to ignore good advise
just because it is coming from someone who is not me and that advise
is based on personal experience which can be very very subjective.</p>
<p>But being skeptical is good. Keep being skeptical.  Don't believe
things easily.</p>
<h1>Be flexible.</h1>
<p>Don't be rigid in your beliefs. Base them on facts. If the facts change, update your beliefs. </p>
<p>Adopt the Baesian mothodology of thinging and reasoning about the world.</p>
<h1>Dont be scared of conflicting information</h1>
<p>Conflicting information means that there is something deeping going on. Dig deeper. Figure it out.</p></div>

Title: Whatsapp

About 2 weeks ago I decided to uninstall whatsapp from my phone. This
was a decision that was many weeks into the making. I will share my
experience and the motivation below.
Before that, let's look at how WhatsApp is designed and how it
encourages a specific type of useage.

## How is WhatsApp supposed to be used ? ##

WhatsApp is what we call an Instant Messaging Applicaiton. The idea
being that you can reach anyone, anywhere instantly. 

The key word here is the "instant" part, and there is very specific
set of features that these apps use to enforce that. Afterall, it's in
the apps best interest to keep the user on the app for the maximum
amount of time. The use of "Last seen", "online/typing", read receipts
etc all work together to create an environment where there is an
innate sense of urgency. All these features enable one person to have
a great deal of information about the person they are communicating
with which other than the fact that is very weird form of privacy
violation, is also creepy.

How many times have we felt frustated that the person we are texting
has "seen" our messages but has not replied ?

How many times have we felt frustated that just because we have "seen"
a message we would have to reply to that message quickly otherwise we
risk offending the other person.


## The Human Aspect of Communication ?! ##
Communication is a very human phenomenon, however communicating via IM
reduces the experience of communication to just an exchange of text
messages and maybe some emojis. Our human communication isn't that
shallow. It is not meant to be that shallow and reducing it to just a
bunch of text exchanges is a perversioin of human values.


When we talk with someone face-to-face or via a phone call, there are
multiple dimensions to it. Sure, there is the normal exchange of
sentences, but at the same time there are multiple other things that
we do not say. Things like, how was the sentence spoken, was it too
fast or too slow, did they sound stressed, did they sound happy, etc
etc. There is yet another multitude of dimension when we are having a
conversation i face-to-face. What was their expression, body language,
what were they doing with their feet, their hands, was there
eye-contact, etc etc. All of this is missing from IM.

Just as a concrete example, I think that "pause"es in a conversation
are very important, they carry a lot of information based on context.
Now, tell me, what is the sustitute of a "pause" in WhatsApp ? I don't
think there is one! I feel that this removes an important part from
the experience.

Hence, it is safe enough to say that IM reduces the human-ness of
communication. This has some interesting consequences. 

## Different persona ##
Over the internet it is much easier to be a completely different
version of yourself. There is a lot of reasons for this, but the lack
of the human-ness of communication is one of them. On the internet it
is very easy to forget that the other person you talking to is a human
being who has feelings and stuff. As mentioned before communication
over the internet is different and its very easy to be more-rude to a
person than one would otherwise be, or to be more-nice to a person
than one would otherwise be. 

A lot of commuication is context and since that is essentailly absent
from IM, it leaves a lot of things up to interpretation on both the
sending and the receiving end.

I've found that over the internet it is much easier to say things that
one would normally not say (both positive and negetive things). Saying
something super rude to someone face-to-face is terrifying, and saying
something super nice is also terrifying. I would like to change that
for myself.


## What was I doing wrong ? ##

Multiple things:

### 1. Simulate human-ness ###
I tried very hard to simulate the human-ness of communication on
IMs. This was wonderfully un-successful. All this lead to was multiple
hours of agony thinking "Did they mean it like this or like that ?"

### 2. The expectation of Instant replies ###
I would expect instant replies to my messages. This got too weird too
fast.  There would be times when I would check the online/typing
status and get pissed if someone was online but not replyig.

I want you to notice how selfish and negetive this line of thinking is
for it completely ignores the fact that the other person is human
being who has some work other than replying to your messages and
instead focuses only on, "they got my message (i can see double
ticks), they saw my message (the ticks are blue), they are online (it
shows online), but they are not replying hence they might be assholes
or they might hate me". This is NOT COOL!!

### 3. Trying too hard to hold on ###
I've moved around a bit and in the process I've lost touch with a
bunch of people. What's interesting is that IM allows us to be
connected in some sort of way without actually being connected.

Like I have a bunch of friends in my WhatsApp contacts with whom I
have not spoken in like years, but they are still there and I get to
see their statuses, and see what they are up to etc etc.

When I was too young to have WhatsApp i did have a bunch of friend who
I lost touch with, and frankly, all I have is just memories of them.

I guess drifting apart is part of the process. I mean, how else would
you know that things have changed.

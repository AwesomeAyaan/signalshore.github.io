### Whats the plan ###

The plan is that there is no plan. We have no idea about what we are trying to do here. All we know is that we will be writing about *stuff* and then publish them. 

This was planned for a long time and we have really put in a lot of effort into making this blog (mostly the design part).

Also since we are learning LISP and like parentheses ([smartparens](https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens) in [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) makes you love parentheses!!) we will be using a lot of parentheses. 

We switched from using vim to using Emacs full time. Vim is good; Emacs is just waaay better (we are not kidding; there will be a post on this some time later ;-) )

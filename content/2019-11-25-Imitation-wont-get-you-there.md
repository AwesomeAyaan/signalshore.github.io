The basic idea. 

How many times when we want to do something do we stop and think that maybe what we are attempting to do is futile because we do not have what the pros have ?

How many times have we convinced ourselves that we need something that the pros have in order to do somthing ?

This is quite true in case of cycling. Cycling happens to be a sport that I like and often times I would box myself in a category that "I cant do that because I don't have this so-and-so expensive bicycle"

I listened to this podcast episode where shruti rajgopalan talks about how the govt engages in this hting called "isomorphic mimicry" which basically means that it tries to mimic good things that the other govts have done elsewhere and implements them in india and then hopes that the outcomes will be the same. Clearly this is false because what works for them will not work for you. 

I realized that this is something I do too. and this is something that almost everyone does. 

Being a programmer there are loads of advise on the interenet about which laptops are good for programmers. Often these "guides" suggest something that is quite significantly expensive and not meant for the average person (with respect to india). 

There is a similar narrative in almost all forms of sport, where we are sold the idea that in order to become a pro or in oder to participate in that sport, you need to have some specialized equipment. 

You need running shoes for running.
You need special climbing shoes for climbing
you need a good laptop for programming.
you need an Gaming PC for gaming
 
If you read books you should buy a e-reader etc etc. 
All of this is just shit advise tbh.

What really matter is to get started. Just get started. And things will sort itself out. :-)

This is also partially inspired by a blog post on surly bikes web page which set me up to just get started.

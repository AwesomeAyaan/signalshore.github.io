# Starting out with Emacs
Like any other person who uses Linux I too started out by using vim as
my default text editor. This was a time when I did not know the
amazing world of vim plugins. It was a good journey for a while and
over time my vim config grew up to a point where it was the perfect
setup.

Then, I discovered Emacs and I moved to Emacs. In the previous
sentence using the work "discovered" is wrong because I did not
"discover" it in the strictest sense of the word. I started using
Emacs because someone (this person is an Emacs and Scheme veteran
(actually a LISP)) told me that the best IDE for learning Scheme is to
use Emacs. Over time I found Emacs to be the most perfect piece of
software that you could possibly want.

Do I sound biased ? Of,course I am! :-P

# Let's dig in ...

### So what is this all about ?? ###
This is about [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) which is
marketed as a Text Editor. This is a huge oversimplification of what
Emacs is.

Let me tell you what Emacs really is. The standard version of Emacs
*without* any extra plugins comes with a text-editor, an interpreter
(for Emacs-Lisp), a package manager (for Emacs), a Planner (org-mode),
a Calendar, a File manager, and a mail/news reader all rolled into one
eco-system. At a fundamental level Emacs is an interpreter for
Emacs-Lisp, all of these goodness comes from the awesomeness of LISP
(or eLISP in this case).

I am unable to form sentences about stuff I wanna say and I really
like lists. So, I will list out stuff and go on explaining them.

This is a list of the reasons why I like Emacs:
  
- The Emacs config is just a eLisp script. This enables it to be
  loaded dynamically and the changes also reflect dynamically without
  having to restart the application. A configuration written in eLisp
  means that you do not have to learn some weird brain-dead language
  just to configure a text editor (I'm looking
  at
  [Vim script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)#Vim_script)).
  
- [Literate Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming):
  By default the Emacs configuration file *init.el* to store the Emacs
  config. This becomes messy as after some time you end up with a
  mess. Thus I decided that it would be a good idea to store the user
  config is a separate file and have Emacs generate the actual
  configuration from it . So I write my config in an Org-mode file and
  I let Emacs handle the
  rest. [This](https://gitlab.com/83bytes/emacs-config) is where I
  have uploaded my Emacs config. The file *init.el* is the default
  Emacs config file. I write my config in the *config.org* file and
  Emacs generates the file *config.el*
  
- [Evil](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil) mode allows me
  to use vim key-bindings. Thus I did not have to retrain the muscle
  memory to learn Emacs
  
- [Magit](https://magit.vc/) to manage git repos. Magit is a Git
  porcelain. It exposes a lot of gits high level functionality through
  a very easy to use interface. The best thing that magit did for me
  was that it got in the habit of staging only certain files or
  sometimes even parts of a file really easily. Also magit logs are so
  much better than git log
  
- [Org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) is just phenomenal. It is a mode
  where Emacs does incredibly amazing things with just text
  files. Before using org-mode I had struggled a lot with to-do
  lists. The first thing that org-mode did for me was to remove that
  problem from my life. After using it for sometime I wanted to
  configure org-mode for myself and it was very easy to do so. So at
  this point I have a configure-able to-do list application. But there
  are other uses more fascinating than the to-do list thingy. Org-mode
  files being just text files are incredibly easy to read even if you
  do not have Emacs. Thus you are not dependent on Emacs.

- Open-ness. The documentation part of Emacs is like the Cherry on
  top. Emacs is like the truly Free and Open Source software. Since
  it is written in LISP which is not compiled, we can view every
  source code that is used in Emacs. In-fact most of the plugins that
  are installed are just big elisp files. Thus, technically it is very
  much possible for a user to change the code of Emacs while it is
  running. In-fact this is exactly what we do when we change the config
  file and load it.
  
- Documentation. Emacs embraces documentation like a boss. With Emacs you have complete transparency. Using the help menu you can see primarily three things, which functions are bound to which keys,  

- Writing Documents. I really hate using a word-processor and honestly
  sometimes using LibreOffice is not so much fun. With org-mode I can
  just write a file in org-mode and then export it to any desired
  format. And this export is not a shitty export. Org-Mode actually
  creates a hierarchical index based on the highlights in
  org-mode. Moreover Org-mode can export the three main formats that I
  need the most - odt, pdf, md (the markdown looks beautiful)

- The Emacs file manager: Dired. Dired is the file manager that comes
  with Emacs. Now how many of you have tried to install a file browser
  in vim because that makes it easier to navigate the source code
  directory ?... Yeah.. Emacs has that built-in. Which means that it
  was much well integrated with the rest of the stuff and also that
  you do not have to put yourself through the agony of installing a
  new plugin
  
- The package system. Emacs has its own package manager and its own
  repositories. This means that installing a new package is as simple
  as 'M-x package-install <RET> package-name <RET>'. Emacs will find
  the package, download it, compile it and do the necessary things on
  its own. Configuring the packages requires some more work but that
  is also taken care of by the configuration system

- [Helm-mode](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Helm). This is a
  framework that enables you to quickly access anything within
  Emacs. This means that with its fuzzy matching, it can fish for
  commands even before you have finished typing your command. Thus you
  can look for Emacs commands and files very fast. It uses an async library in
  the back-end that makes it this fast.
  
- LISP. Emacs is the best possible IDE for learning
  LISP. With [Geiser](http://www.nongnu.org/geiser/) I can now run a
  scheme REPL inside Emacs while I write code and then execute them
  from the file itself. This is just seamless and amazing.
 
- [Server mode](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Emacs-Server.html). Emacs
  is quite heavy, so it takes some time to startup. This means that
  the typical workflow which I used to have with vim would never work
  here. With vim i would just open a new instance of vim wherever I
  needed it. Vim is small and fast. But with Emacs it doesn't make
  sense to open a new instance of Emacs for editing a new file. The
  solution is to us the Emacs Server Mode. In this mode Emacs runs a
  server daemon and we can use the program 'emacsclient' to connect to
  the server. Emacsclient does not create a new instance of Emacs,
  instead it connects to the Emacs server and merely opens a new frame
  or it sends that file to the already opened frame. After editing the
  file we can close that file and it will be saved normally. Thus now
  I can edit a file from anywhere I want within this system. Also
  editing the desktop entry to Emacs enabled me to add a code snippet
  that will call emacsclient whenever I try to open any text file from
  the File Manager.

## Other Cool stuff ##
Here are some other interesting things that you can do with Emacs that
I want to try out.

- elfeed. This is a client that reads RSS and ATOM feeds.
- mail client. Some of my friends use Emacs as their email client. I
  haven't gotten around to doing it yet.
- EXWM. This is a window manager that uses Emacs. Its called Emacs
  Window Manager. I have used it briefly but I have not switched to it
  yet.

## Conclusion ##
Emacs is great! 
Vim is great too.

Emacs is a religion.

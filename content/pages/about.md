### What is this ? ###

This is is SignalShore. This is my blog and/or site (or information sharing system).

### Why this ?  ###

- I want this to be a live documentation of what I am learning/working on at any point of time. 
- Journalling in this form helps me track what I've learnt and other intersting things that I encounter
- Writing is a great feedback mechanism and it helps me to identify holes in the knowledge
- I like telling people about things I find interesting; thus this blog gives me a huge audience (possibly non-existent)
- I like talking to myself. (I think everyone does this to a certain extent). So this blog is like a brian-splatter for me. 
- It's *cool* to have a blog. :-P

Most of the content on this site is just me blabbering on and on....

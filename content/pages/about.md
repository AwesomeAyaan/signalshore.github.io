*"An obstacle downstream propagates upstream. If you're not allowed
to implement new ideas, you stop having them. And vice versa: when
you can do whatever you want, you have more ideas about what to
do. So [keeping a blog] makes your brain more powerful in the same
way a low-restriction exhaust system makes an engine more powerful."
— Paul Graham (who was writing about startups rather than blogging)*

Hi,my name is Sohom. I started SignalShore in 2017 as a *sounding
board* and an outlet for my intellectual curiosity.

I am interested in almost everything and there is a *lot* to learn. In
order to keep up with the universe and to keep the hunger satiated
one requires a high throughput, highly efficient system, which for me
is this blog. 

I have experienced
that [writing](http://www.paulgraham.com/essay.html) is an exceptional
aid to thinking; it helps me think clearly, it helps me serialize my
thoughts properly (which BTW my notebook does not do) and most importantly
it helps me identify holes in my reasoning.

Writing helps me clear the system for even more ideas.

This is my excuse to try out new ideas and to learn new things.

## "SignalShore" ? ##

I asked a friend for something "different". He suggested 4 names. This was the only one that was available at that point. It's surprising that this was not my first choice. Now that I think about it, the hindi word for "noise" is "shore". So I guess I can say its something to do with signal and noise.

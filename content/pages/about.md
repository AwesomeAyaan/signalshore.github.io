# About
*"An obstacle downstream propagates upstream. If you're not allowed
to implement new ideas, you stop having them. And vice versa: when
you can do whatever you want, you have more ideas about what to
do. So [keeping a blog] makes your brain more powerful in the same
way a low-restriction exhaust system makes an engine more powerful."
— Paul Graham (who was writing about startups rather than blogging)*

Hi, my name is Sohom. I started SignalShore in 2017 as a *sounding
board* and an outlet for my intellectual curiosity.

I am interested in almost everything and there is a *lot* to learn. In
order to keep up with the universe and to keep the hunger satiated
one requires a high throughput, highly efficient system, which for me
is this blog. 

I have experienced
that [writing](http://www.paulgraham.com/essay.html) is an exceptional
*form* of thinking. Often, I expand on ideas as I am writing them. It
took a lot of effort to get used to being empty inside my head but
flowing on the keyboard. But as Paul Grahm has said; *Expressing ideas
helps to form them*. Not only that, turns out who you express it for
also affects you.

When I started out, my intended audience was myself, but as I kept at
it, I realized that when I write, I like to write as if someone will
read them. This means that what I write needs to have some
standard. Just as inviting people over forces you to clean up your
apartment, writing something that other people will read forces you to
think well. So it does matter to have an audience. Otherwise I could
write 10000 words that do not mean anything about no particular
topic. That is not good.

Writing helps me write better and hence it help me think better.

This blog is my excuse to try out new ideas, to learn new things and
to do it properly.

## "SignalShore" ? ##

I asked a friend for something "different". He suggested 4 names. This
was the only one that was available at that point. It's surprising
that this was not my first choice. Now that I think about it, the
hindi word for "noise" is "shore". So I guess I can say its something
to do with signal and noise.
